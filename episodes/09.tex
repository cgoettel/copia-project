\begin{verse}
Upon the skatepark in Provo, ~~~~banked and curved.

Upon the sloped ramps ~~~~and upon the circular pipes.

Upon the banked transitions ~~~~and upon the curved quarters.

Upon all the parks in Utah, ~~~~upon all the beautiful parks:

~~~~their banks shall be rideable, ~~~~the curves of the park shall be made smooth.

Who believes what we've said? ~~~~To whom has Colby's tale been told?

He grew up as a fat kid, ~~~~not as a skater.

~~~~He doesn't have the appearance. ~~~~When we look at him, we don't desire him as a skater.

~~~~He is looked down upon, scorned by other skaters. ~~~~A loner who knows solitude.

But surely he can skate ~~~~and ride the quarter,

~~~~yet we thought him incapable: ~~~~too old and rigid to skate.

~~~~He biffed and he bailed, ~~~~but he kept his trucks on the ground.

~~~~He rode to the quarter. ~~~~He rode like a practiced skater

~~~~so he didn't doubt.

~~~~He was thrilled to get wrecked~--- to get hurt~--- ~~~~though it all helps to learn.

~~~~He will see this through. His skating days will be lengthened. ~~~~This great pastime shall prosper in his hand.

~~~~He will see the fruits of his labors.

Be glad, O learner. ~~~~Break forth into rejoicing; get stoked because you've ridden the quarter!

~~~~Increase your skill. ~~~~Stretch out your arms in triumph.

~~~~Don't hold back.
