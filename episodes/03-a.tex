This round I am focusing on changing pace. I want to use more descriptive language and have the sentence length help to determine the pace. Because of these things, this episode will also, hopefully, be more narrative~--- shying away from my ``just the facts, ma'am'' style. Target word count is anywhere in the range of the first two episodes, viz.: 221--282.

Afterthought: it felt good to write creatively like this. It's been close to eleven years since I've done so. On word count: I think I've tinkered with this enough now. I've edited and edited. The word count is just below what I was aiming for, but the conclusion is too good to push around. The paragraphs are of equal length. The third paragraph is a great breath. Typographically, it's beautiful. I can't touch this one any more.
