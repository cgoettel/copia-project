I don't really know what to do with this anymore. Am I done with it? It feels done. And it felt better last week than this. Ideas on where to go? What to do?

I tried writing something from a different point of view and just couldn't get into it. It's tough to write about yourself and not sound pompous. Especially when you don't like talking about yourself. Instead, I'm going to take the previous episode (copy and paste) and work a little on verb phrases and descriptive language. Try to have longer sentences. Here's hoping I don't botch it.
