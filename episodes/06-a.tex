In this episode I would like to not just copy and paste the whole thing and dink around with a few words. I want to expand on the idea of failing to commit. I want to enumerate my failures (try to get a montage going). The quarter pipe scene needs to be shortened because it doesn't take that long. The part about my heart being in my throat takes too long, the quarter pipe isn't that friendly.

Additionally, I'm using a lot more skating vernacular in this episode because it's really the best way to describe it. I have an unfair advantage in writing this episode because I can always go to the skate park and get inspiration, others have to rely solely on memory.

Finally, the first colon is typographically intentional.
