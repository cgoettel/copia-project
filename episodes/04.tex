The smooth feeling of a skateboard as it glasses across a box and down a ramp. Timing the transitions so I don't lose balance. It's all muscle memory at this point: instinctive, natural. I go up and down the pyramid, the last obstacle before my old foe, the quarter pipe. Heart pounding, shift my feet, transition, pivot, heart in my throat, come back down.

Pure exhilaration as I ride back to my starting point: I have finally landed my first quarter pipe. Sloppy, but conquered. This goofy smile spreads across my exhausted face. I am absolutely stoked. It is a feeling like nothing the world over. In skateboarding, you don't have a coach or a trainer, it's just you against yourself. In skateboarding, you are your closest ally and your most feared opponent. In skateboarding, when you mess up you get hurt.

You get hurt pretty often.

But it's all worth it. Ever since I was twelve I have wanted to learn how to skate. Thirteen years later and I finally bought a deck. Took long enough. Earlier this year I couldn't stand on a board without falling off. Zero sense of balance. Completely uncomfortable. It took months to learn the basics. Now it's onto the harder tricks. To this day the quarter pipe remains my foe, but I slowly conquer it. It slowly becomes muscle memory, just like balancing, pushing, transitioning.
