Skateboarding, that great sport, stretches forth its arms, beckoning, welcoming. Shall we not embrace it as friends? Surely we shall! for turning our backs on it, casting it aside, will only leave us empty, destitute of the joy it brings.

All great things can be had only through pain and endurance, suffering and hardship. By wading through torrents of mistakes we shall find ourselves capable. By sailing through the tossing sea we shall reach our destiny. When our muscles are trained, our fears fade, discomfort fades, hesitance fades, and by our training we are made strong and fade not.

Shrink not from this glorious task! Trust in yourself, in your training, in your mind. Be resolute, and your task, though abrupt and steep, shall be made carved and smooth before you. Think not of the obstacles that do so easily beset you, for they are as the graven images of Mizraim. Cast them aside, leave them behind you and march forward unto Canaan.

With these obstacles behind you, eyes keen, attention focused, prepare for the glory to be had on the quarter pipe. It is truly a small thing, not worthy of our fears. Simple preparation and well-practiced timing will lead us to the victory. Prepare yourself, be strong, resolute, the quarter pipe~--- Canaan~--- is nigh; it fast approaches. Crouch, pivot, balance. Ride off to glory, O skater. Rejoice!
