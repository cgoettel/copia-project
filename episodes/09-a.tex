This is an imitation of Isaiah. I've spent a lot of time in the past couple years translating his work so I wanted to pay homage to it. Most of Isaiah is Hebrew poetry which is not built on rhythm and rhyme, but on parallelisms. This imitation episode is based on the following passages in Isaiah: 2:13--16, 53:1--11 (selections throughout), 54:1.
