It took months to learn the basics. In skateboarding, you don't have a coach or trainer, it's just you against yourself. In skateboarding, when you mess up you get hurt.

You get hurt pretty often.

But it's worth it~--- every scar, every scare, every sore muscle. I have wanted to learn how to skate since I was twelve. I am truly passionate about few things and I seem to have found another for my short list. Took long enough. Earlier this year I couldn't stand on a board without falling off. Every time I got on a board felt like the first time. Zero sense of balance. Long months later and I'd finally learned the basics. Now it's onto the harder tricks. Onto the quarter pipe.

That smooth, familiar feeling of a skateboard glassing across a box and down a ramp. Timing the transitions, trying not to lose my balance. It's mostly muscle memory at this point, instinctive, natural. A little shaky as I go up and down the pyramid, the last obstacle before my new foe, the quarter pipe. Heart pounding, shift my feet, heart rising, transition, pivot, heart in my throat, come back down.

Pure exhilaration as I ride back to my starting point: I have finally landed my first quarter pipe. My heart, still quivering, begins to settle as this goofy smile spreads across my exhausted face. I am stoked, absolutely stoked. But the day is long from over: I must practice and practice again. Landing once is not enough. It must become muscle memory, just like balancing, pushing, transitioning.
