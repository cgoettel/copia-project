This episode is hopefully going to read more like a short story than a 220 word entry. I want to increase word count to around 300. I want the next episode to conclude this one.

This episode will also focus on free modifiers and repetition. I'm going to pay conscious attention to how I branch sentences, to how I repeat information worth emphasizing. I also want to increase the average sentence length (to around 11--12). I struggle to understand basic sentences which is why my sentences are always so short. That needs to change.
