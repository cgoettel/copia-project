For over half of my life I've wanted to learn how to skate. Unfortunately, my footing and balance early on were awkward at best. A few months back, I decided that enough was enough. I was going to learn how to skate. Dammit.

Once I learned how to balance, I needed to learn how to ride ramps and quarter pipes. Nothing in skating comes easy. Everything requires commitment and at least a little pain. Sometimes a lot. Four days into learning ramps and I finally had them down. Locked. But the very next day I couldn't do them. I'd always been told to bend my knees, but with a history of broken knees, a blown meniscus, and an almost popped PCL the day before I was wary of trying. Throwing caution to the wind, I listened to my friend's~--- everyone's~--- suggestion and bent my knees. I knocked it out of the park. Amazed myself. And can now consistently do this.

Skateboarding is an odd sport. There's no coach, no trainer, nothing. It's just you against yourself. It's helped me be a better student, a better friend, and a better person. It's taught me how to commit and challenge myself, how to learn on my own, to set goals and achieve them. But most importantly, it's taught me to trust my friends.
