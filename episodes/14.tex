Plank of wood, front foot firm, back foot kicking, glassing across a box. It's familiar, inspiring~--- it's instinct. As wind blows through my hair, I hit a transition, transition again, flit across a pyramid, float across hard, unforgiving ground, draw up a bit of grit, and fortify my mind for this coming transition: this is glory, this is honor: this is why I hurt, why blood spots my clothing. Days and days that I can't walk, that standing hurts, that moving is hard, all from this sport, from this compulsion, this fascination. But it's worth it. Blood drips, I stink, I anguish in pain, but I can't stop.

I took on this sport six months ago. I couldn't stand on a board six months ago. I couldn't push six months ago. But I can now. I did it. I won. But this obstruction still stands in my way; it is taunting, uncaring, harsh. It is my undoing. This bandit constantly putting down my ambition and fantasy, this rival pulling down my glory and honor, will stand in my way so long as I fail. I will not fail. I cannot fail. So I try.
