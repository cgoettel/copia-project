Ever since I was twelve I have wanted to learn to skateboard. My footing and balance were always just a little off and I could never get the grasp of it. Four months ago I made the decision to man up and learn how to skate. It was one of the best decisions of my life.

Skating does more for my life than anything else. When you go skating, there's no coach. There's no trainer. It's just you against yourself. Skating has taught me to be a better student because I've learned how to set and accomplish goals.

It took a solid week to learn how to one-eighty pivot a ramp. It took a week after that to transfer that knowledge to a quarter pipe. My friend, Matt, told me that I needed to learn to bend my knees~--- pump~--- when I approach any type of ramp. Coming from a history of broken knees this didn't seem too appealing to me. I kept pushing it off and pushing it off. Saying that I could do just as well without bending my knees. Worse, I thought I was right. I learned to one-eighty pivot a quarter without bending my knees and I got stoked.

A few days after I had learned this, I realized that I couldn't consistently perform this trick. How frustrating that was! So, in an act of desperation, I bent my knees. And wouldn't you know it, I did the trick better than I ever had.

Skateboarding has taught me many things. Highest on that list is to continually challenge myself. To commit. To get up and go again when I'm hurt. But most of all, to trust my friends.
