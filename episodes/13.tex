\begin{verse}
``--- get this, I've always had excuses, had school, \\
something getting in the \\
way \\
but now \\
I've ditched my friends, I got myself a \\
skatepark, a street plaza, you gotta check it out, ride \\
it. \\
for my college years I'll have this \\
park and space to \\
ride.''

~

no bro, if you're going to skate \\
you're going to skate regardless of responsibilities \\
15 credits of school \\
or \\
you'll skate in a living room with a mini ramp \\
while you're on \\
crutches, \\
you're gonna skate with pieces of your knee and your hip blown \\
out, \\
you're gonna skate cold \\
bruised \\
broken, \\
you're gonna skate with a young mom yelling at your \\
back while \\
the walkers decry loser, no-good, \\
faggot and poser.

~

br\r{a}, time and freedom and money and age \\
don't make a good skater \\
and don't add to the scene \\
except possibly a more boring life to \\
escape \\
from. \\
