In this week's episode, Colby uses the grand style.

This will be rather reminiscent of the King James Version which is funny because I can't stand that translation. Some of the grammar and punctuation will be a little archaic, bear with me. This episode is really showing me how much more time I spend in the Bible than in any other book. Hebrew has destroyed my English.

% I'd like to spend more time on the grand style. I don't really get it.
% next week: middle style. pleasing.
