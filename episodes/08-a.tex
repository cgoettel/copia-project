This episode is going to focus on using punctuation and spacing (think colometry) to mimic my breathing and thinking. I want it to feel like the reader has plugged into my brain and is hearing my every thought. It will be stream of conscious which means there will be random thoughts and a little cursing.

The bolded portions are onomatopoeia or actions. When the board makes a sharp transition, the wheels click. The part of the skatepark that I'm at in this episode is not the normal place I write about~--- it's off on the south side. It's a ramp, a straightaway, and part of a bowl. It's where I practiced the quarter pipe before moving on to the big(ger) one that's been features previously.

A note on how I think so that this episode makes sense: when I think, I create a projection of someone in my head and I have a conversation with them. I never talk to myself, always to someone else. And when I do address myself, I don't use the first person or refer to myself as Colby. I call myself ``moron'' or some other name. I'm really mean to myself, but it's all in good fun. The words don't actually mean anything, they're just words. Don't wear a sensitive sweater as you read this.

All in all, this episode should feel rather conversational. If you were having a conversation with a total jerk.
