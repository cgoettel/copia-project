The smooth feeling of a skateboard as it glasses across a box and down a ramp. Balancing and bending my knees in time with the transitions. It's all muscle memory at this point. It's instinctive, natural. I go up the pyramid and down the backside, balancing and bending as I go. Up comes the quarter pipe. Heart pounding, shift my feet, transition, pivot, come back down.

Pure exhilaration as I ride back to my starting point: I have finally managed to land my first quarter pipe. This goofy smile spreads across my face. I am absolutely stoked. It is a feeling like no other. In skateboarding, there is no coach or trainer, just you against yourself. In skateboarding, you are your closest ally and your most feared opponent. In skateboarding, when you mess up you get hurt.

You get hurt pretty often.

But it's all worth it. Ever since I was twelve I have wanted to learn how to skate. Thirteen years later and I finally bought a deck. Earlier this year I couldn't stand on a board without falling off. It took months to learn how to balance, push, and maneuver. Now it's onto the harder tricks. The quarter pipe remains my foe, but I slowly conquer it. It slowly becomes muscle memory, just like balancing, pushing, transitioning.
