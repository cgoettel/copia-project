Ideally, I'd like to drop my word count by 20\% (target word count of 226). I'm going to try to be a bit more conversational and to use short sentences to pivot the paragraph. Using all four types of English sentences isn't the highest priority. I'd like them to be present, but I'm not going to be anal retentive about it. Really, I just want my voice to flow naturally. That's going to mean lots of contractions and maybe a swear word or two. Whoops. Finally, I want to try to write longer sentences (and longer paragraphs) and intersperse them with short sentences. I really struggle at writing long sentences and paragraphs because almost everything that I read nowadays is Church-produced materials and they're all about brevity for their demographic.
