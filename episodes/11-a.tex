This episode is a continuation and conclusion of the previous episode. I want to focus on imitating the style that was used last week so that there is a high level of cohesion between the two. Searching for a conclusion for this was the hardest part because at times it felt like I should extend this story to three episodes. I really didn't want to do that. Pay attention to the conclusion and let me know what you think.

I tried to convey more emotion through the italicized portions, facts through prose.
