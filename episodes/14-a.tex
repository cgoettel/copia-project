% some time: have fun with homonyms and see how much we can make Grant cringe. E.g., "Please except my apology." "I want to be apart of this."

% another time: never use the letter e.
% try to use longer sentences (with variety in sentence length still). Go for a 50.

I want to go back to a previous episode where I used descriptive language, but work on varying sentence length. The goal is a 50 word sentence. I'm trying to evoke the emotion that I feel about skateboarding.

I'm also trying something else here: see if you can spot this one.
