Originally, I was going to write about my recent fishing trip in Alaska. I didn't want to get on a personal level and then have to revisit it all semester, so I decided on skateboarding (logically). Skateboarding is one of my few passions. I long to skate. I miss it when I don't. It won't be hard to write about this all semester. This passage was almost entirely stream of consciousness, but some things definitely seemed to come together. Bonus. I apologize for any skate slang that appears here: it's just how you talk about it.
