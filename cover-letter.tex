\thispagestyle{empty}My customary practice was to turn in the episodes on Friday, have them returned Monday, revise in class, make the final revisions in digital form after class, and leave it alone.

The imitations are episodes 9 and 13.

The best episode is number 10. I feel that this really shows my best writing from the semester. I love the story, the narrative, the introspection. Episode 11 is a continuation of 10 and is of note for that reason alone. Also of note is the last episode, 14, because it was the hardest piece I have ever written. In my life. I never used the letter \textit{e} which proved an immensely difficult task.

The total word count is 4857 not including headers.
